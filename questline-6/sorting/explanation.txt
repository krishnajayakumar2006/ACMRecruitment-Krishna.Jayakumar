initialise a list 'n'
starting a for loop so that arranging of elements happen till the largest element reach the right side
           that ie,.... all the elemnts are compared to all the other elements
           another loop is created in this loop to get all the elements from start to end (""j"" from 0 to len(n))
                   if statement is given to check if the value of j is length of n(if s there is no point in sorting anymore as we have reached the end of the list)
                              break condition is given to begin sorting onceagain from the begining
                   elif (if the first elements is greater than the second this statement is executed)
                              first element if switched with the second element such that the second element is the highest
printing the modified list
