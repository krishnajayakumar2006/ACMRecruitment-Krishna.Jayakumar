iteration method-> it is the method by which a program is done using for loop,while loop etc....
first initialised a string containing the "amrita"
initialise another empty string called new_string
start a "for" loop thats runs till the number of char in the string .....
              adding the last char from the string to string_new
printing new_string after for loop is completed
